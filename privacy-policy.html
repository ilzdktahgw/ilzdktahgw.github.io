<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p>Last updated on March 30, 2022</p>

  <h2>What personal information do I collect?</h2>

  <p>I do not collect any personal information from you. However, third party advertising service providers I use in my apps may collect some personal information. (See Data collected by AdMob)</p>

  <h2>Information I collect</h2>

  <p>I may collect some anonymous data automatically.</p>

  <p>Device information (from Apple or Google Play): I may collect basic device information, such as the device’s operating system version, using Apple or Google Play’s built-in analytics.</p>

  <p>Installation information (from Apple or Google Play): I may collect information about your installation, including, but not limited to, the date and country location of your installation, using Apple or Google Play’s built-in analytics.

  <p>Purchase information (from RevenueCat): If you choose to make a purchase, I may collect some basic information about your purchase, including, but not limited to, your purchase history and type of purchase (e.g. subscription), using RevenueCat’s service.</p>

  <h2>Data collected by AdMob:</h2>

  <p>Google’s AdMob is an advertising service provider I use to show you ads.</p>

  <h2>How data is used</h2>

  <p>Data from third party service providers are used for analytics and app functionality.</p>

  <p>Data collected by AdMob may be used for analytics and to serve personalized ads.</p>

  <p>App data stored locally on your device using SQLite, and NSUserDefaults on iOS or SharedPreferences on Android is used for app functionality.</p>

  <h2>California Residents</h2>

  <p>Personalized advertising is disabled (and cannot be enabled) for all residents of California. This means that no personal information is collected.</p>

  <h2>Data protection rights under GDPR</h2>

  <p>Personal information may be collected if you choose to enabled personalized advertising. If you consented to personalized advertising and wish to change your consent, go to Settings > Ad Settings in the app to change your consent.</p>

  <h3>Opt out of personalized advertising</h3>

  <p>If you are a resident of the EEA or UK and wish to opt out of personalized advertising, refer to “Data protection rights under GDPR” above. Or you can follow the steps below. (Or both). </p>

  <p>To opt out of personalized advertising, go to the privacy settings of the device and:</p>

  <p>iOS: Turn off “Allow Apps to Request to Track” or select “Limit Ad Tracking”</p>
  <p>Android: Select “Opt out of Ads personalization”</p>
  <p>If you have trouble finding these settings, search “How to disable personalized ads on (iOS/Android).”</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>

  <p>I do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16. Ads are served without using any personal information to children.</p>

  <h2>Information security</h2>

  <p>I do not store any of your data. Data from third party service providers should be securely stored with them.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>

  <p>I may update my privacy policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>

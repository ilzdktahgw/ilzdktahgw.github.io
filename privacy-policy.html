What data do I collect?
I do not collect any data from you. However, third party service providers I use may automatically collect some personal and non-personal information. For example, they may collect device information such as your device model and the operating system, ip address, product interactions such as app launches and taps, diagnostic information such as crash logs and energy usage, and device identifiers. Please refer to their privacy policy for more information on what data they collect.

How is your data used?
Data collected from third party service providers may be collected and shared for analytics, fraud prevention, and to serve personalized advertisements.

Data security
I do not store any of your data. Data from third party service providers should be securely stored with them.

California Residents
Personalized advertising is disabled (and cannot be enabled) for all residents of California. This means that no personal information is collected.

Data protection rights under GDPR
Personal information may be collected if you consent to personalized advertising. If you wish to change your consent, go to Settings > Ad Settings in the app.

Opt out of personalized advertising
If you are a resident of the EEA or UK and wish to opt out of personalized advertising, refer to “Data protection rights under GDPR” above. Or you can follow the steps below. (Or both).
· iOS: In the privacy settings of your device, go to "tracking" settings and turn it off for any apps you want. On older iOS devices, you may need to find and turn off a setting called "limit ad tracking"
· Android: Find and select “Opt out of Ads personalization” in your device privacy settings. Different Android versions may require different steps.
· If you have trouble finding these settings, search “How to disable personalized ads on iOS/Android.”

Children
I do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16. Ads are served without using any personal information to children.

Acceptance of this policy
You acknowledge that you have read this policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this policy, you are not allowed to use any of my apps.

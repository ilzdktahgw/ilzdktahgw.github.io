Personalized advertising is disabled (and cannot be enabled) for all residents of California. This means that no personal information is collected.

To opt out of personalized advertising, go to the privacy settings of the device and:

If you have trouble finding these settings, search “How to disable personalized ads on (iOS/Android).”

Children

I do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16. Ads are served without using any personal information to children.

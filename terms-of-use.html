Last updated on March 18, 2024

Before using any apps made by Justln Apps Inc., you must agree to these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use any of the apps.

· The use of hacks, cheats, and unauthorized third-party software is strictly prohibited.
· Modification of files is strictly prohibited.
· Any commercial use or exploitation of the apps is strictly prohibited.


The following currently applies to app versions with purchases.

</pre>

<h4>Purchases</h4>
<pre>
You may purchase an auto-renewing subscription through an In-App Purchase. If you subscribe, you will receive a 3-day free trial if it is your first subscription, after which your subscription will be charged to your Apple or Google account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew at the duration selected unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

If available, you may purchase a lifetime special offer to access to all features of the app forever for a one-time payment. If you already have an active subscription and would like to purchase the offer, please cancel your subscription before making the purchase to avoid being charged again for the subscription when it ends. Purchasing the offer will NOT automatically cancel any active subscriptions.

</pre>
	
<h4>Missing a payment</h4>
<pre>
If your auto-renewal fails due to billing issues, you will receive a grace period to allow you to fix your billing issues or cancel the subscription. This grace period will allow you to continue to receive the subscription’s full benefits until it is over, or until you cancel the subscription. If the grace period ends, you will lose all benefits of the subscription.	

</pre>

<h4>Cancellations</h4>
<pre>
An active subscription may not be cancelled during the active subscription period. However, you can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by visiting your Apple or Google account settings after purchase. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to receive its full benefits until the subscription ends. Please make sure that you’ve cancelled the subscription before your next payment if you no longer want it.

</pre>

<h4>Refunds</h4>
<pre>
Justln Apps Inc. does not offer refunds for any purchases you've made. If you would like a refund, please request a refund from Apple or Google.
	
</pre>

<h4>Upgrading and downgrading a subscription</h4>
<pre>
How good your subscription is depends on its duration. This means the yearly subscription is better than the monthly subscription. The benefits are the same. If you upgrade or downgrade your subscription, you will be billed when your current subscription ends. If you want to upgrade or downgrade your subscription, please make sure to do so before your next payment.

</pre>

<h4>Price changes</h4>
<pre>
Prices may change at any time. You should be notified of subscription price changes from Apple or Google. You may not be notified of price changes for the lifetime special offer.
	
</pre>

<h4>Changes to these Terms of Use</h4>
<pre>
These Terms of Use may be updated from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
	
</pre>

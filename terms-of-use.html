<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<pre>Last updated on March 30, 2022

Introduction

Before using any of my apps, you must agree to these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy.

By installing or using any of my apps, you agree to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not install or use any of my apps.

User Restrictions

The use of hacks, cheats, and unauthorized third-party software is strictly prohibited.
Modification of files is strictly prohibited.
Any commercial use or exploitation of my apps is strictly prohibited.
Ownership

I own everything in my apps and everything that makes up my apps. This includes, but is not limited to, any computer code, themes, concepts, titles, and artwork.

Payments and Billing

Purchases:

I only offer auto-renewing subscriptions in my apps, renewing either monthly or yearly. I do not offer any other types of in-app purchases. If you choose to subscribe, you must use real money and pay the full amount of the subscription to receive all of its benefits for its full duration.

Missing a payment:

If your auto-renewal fails due to billing issues, you will receive a grace period of 14 days for Android devices and 16 days for iOS devices to allow you to fix your billing issues or cancel the subscription. This grace period will allow you to continue to receive the subscription’s full benefits until it is over, or until you cancel the subscription. If the grace period ends, you will lose all benefits of the subscription.

Cancellations:

You may cancel your subscription at any time. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to receive its full benefits until your current subscription ends. Please make sure that you’ve cancelled the subscription before your next payment if you no longer want it. You should be notified of upcoming payments from either Google or Apple. I am not responsible for any problems with Google or Apple notifying you of upcoming payments.

Refunds:

I do not offer any refunds for purchases made by you. However, Google or Apple may issue a refund. Please check with their Terms and Conditions for more information.

Upgrading and downgrading a subscription:

How good your subscription is depends on its duration. This means the yearly subscription is better than the monthly subscription. The benefits are the same. If you upgrade or downgrade your subscription, you will be billed when your current subscription ends. If you want to upgrade or downgrade your subscription, please make sure to do so before your next payment.

Price changes:

Prices may change at any time. However, I will try my best to keep the prices as they are. You should be notified of price changes from either Google or Apple. I am not responsible for any problems with Google or Apple notifying you of upcoming price changes.

Changes to these Terms of Use

I may update these Terms of Use from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions regarding the Terms of Use or any of my apps, feel free to contact me at support@justln.ca.</pre>

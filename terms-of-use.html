Last updated on March 18, 2024

Before using any apps made by Justln Apps Inc., you must agree to these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use any of the apps.

· The use of hacks, cheats, and unauthorized third-party software is strictly prohibited.
· Modification of files is strictly prohibited.
· Any commercial use or exploitation of the apps is strictly prohibited.


The following currently applies only to Apple Apps; Android Apps do not have purchases

</pre>

<h4>Purchases</h4>
<pre>
You may purchase an auto-renewing subscription through an In-App Purchase. If you subscribe, your subscription will be charged to your Apple account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew at the duration selected unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
	
</pre>
	
<h4>Missing a payment</h4>
<pre>
If your auto-renewal fails due to billing issues, you will receive a grace period of 28 days to allow you to fix your billing issues or cancel the subscription. This grace period will allow you to continue to receive the subscription’s full benefits until it is over, or until you cancel the subscription. If the grace period ends, you will lose all benefits of the subscription.	

</pre>

<h4>Cancellations</h4>
<pre>
Current subscription may not be cancelled during the active subscription period. However, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your Apple account settings after purchase. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to receive its full benefits until your current subscription ends. Please make sure that you’ve cancelled the subscription before your next payment if you no longer want it. You should be notified of upcoming payments from Apple.

</pre>

<h4>Refunds</h4>
<pre>
Justln Apps Inc. does not offer any refunds for purchases made by you. However, Google or Apple may issue a refund. Please check with their Terms and Conditions for more information.
	
</pre>

<h4>Upgrading and downgrading a subscription</h4>
<pre>
How good your subscription is depends on its duration. This means the yearly subscription is better than the monthly subscription. The benefits are the same. If you upgrade or downgrade your subscription, you will be billed when your current subscription ends. If you want to upgrade or downgrade your subscription, please make sure to do so before your next payment.

</pre>

<h4>Price changes</h4>
<pre>
Prices may change at any time. You should be notified of price changes from Apple.
	
</pre>

<h4>Changes to these Terms of Use</h4>
<pre>
These Terms of Use may be updated from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
	
</pre>

<h4>Contact Information</h4>
